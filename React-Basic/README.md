# React Basic
* After learning react in the last 3 weeks, I want to go back to basic and reflect on what I had learned about Reactjs.

* Takeaway: There are many ways to install react work environment, the most popular one is NPM + Babel 6 + Webpack

### What make this project different: I want to transition one of my basic HTML+CSS+JS project into React project, but how should I do that? I recreate this React basic project base on the fact that I already had a old static HTML+CSS+JS website.
