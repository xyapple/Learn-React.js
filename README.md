# Learn-React.js
## This Repository is 2017 summer project. I will learn React.js in the next 3 months.
### First folder: Try-React is where I learn to setup a React locally by following react tutorial: https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html
### Dealing with JSX
* “Let your browser rely on a JavaScript library to automatically convert JSX to something it understands.”
